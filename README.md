# APTOS2019 blindness detection

Solution for the [Kaggle APTOS 2019 Blindness competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/overview). A deep learning model is used for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy (also knowns as diabetic eye disease) using fundus images. This is my capstone project for [Udacity's machine learning engineer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t).

### Getting Started

The dataset is available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data). For this project, I only used the 3662 labeled training images. To getting started, downloaded and extracted images have to be stored to data/train_images/.

Required packages can installed via `requirements.txt`.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Code is embedded in the jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` .
