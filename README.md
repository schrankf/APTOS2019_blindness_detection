# APTOS2019_blindness_detection

Solution for the [Kaggle APTOS 2019 Blindness competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/overview). A deep learning model is used for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy (also knowns as diabetic eye disease) using fundus images. This is my capstone project for [Udacity's machine learning engineer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t).



## Data
